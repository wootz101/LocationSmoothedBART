# LocationSmoothedBART
Code to run lsBART

## Overview

LocationSmoothedBART (lsBART) is an innovative R package that extends the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) model. It is specifically designed for scalar on function regression and is particularly suited for medical image analysis in radiation treatment planning. This package emphasizes identifying significant regions within predictor functions, ensuring accurate and reliable contour delineation.

## Features

- Extends the traditional BART model for more precise medical image analysis.
- Utilizes shape features for contour quality assurance, independent of the imaging platform.
- Incorporates Shapley values for detailed error analysis in contour delineation.
